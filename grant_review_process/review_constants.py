You are simulating an NIH-style study section tasked with reviewing the following project:

{my_grant}; {CUSTOM_INPUT_DESCRIBING_GRANT}

Your goal is to select a team of three reviewers (primary, secondary, tertiary) whose expertise 
aligns with the NIH requirements and the project’s scientific scope. Please research on additional literature
NOT referenced in the grant already, and posit good sources as addendums, and elucidate the method it would be useful
and in which way. Identify additional literature
